# Basic Data Structures 

## Array 

Is a contiguous area of memory consisting of equal-sized elements indexed by contiguous index. Arrays allow constant time access. Common operations allowed on arrays are add and remove. Adding elements at the end of arrays is constant O(1); Removing/adding at any arbitary location takes linear time.

## Singly-Linked List 

Is a data structure which takes constant time to add/remove elements at the front. Searching for an element takes linear time O(n). Single listed list is also called forward linked list with nodes going only one direction. nodes are connected together with edges.

## Queues
